# Wow Panic - TechSummit 2017 IBM Hackathon (First prize :crown:)

_Wow Panic_ is a smart bracelet that shows you the probability of being harassed in a neighborhood, and sends a message to your loved ones and the police when pressed. 

We've used NodeJS for the backend, TensorFlow the machine learning, Pug & Bootstrap for the frontend, and Cordova for the mobile application. We've also used IBM Bluemix platform for the DB (Cloudant & Mongo), IoT connection, and to run our NodeJS application.
